			To Know Before You Start:
		</div>
		<br/>

		Leadership quality is always one of the top qualities foreign university admissions officers look for when evaluating applicants. However, due to the fact that China is huge and there are great language and cultural barriers between Chinese candidates and foreign admissions officers, it is very difficult for foreign university to evaluate applicant's involvement and achievement through extracurricular activities. We are here to help! After discussing with AOs aboard, they suggested us to create a system where student leaders can describe their activities and impacts in a more detailed and transparent manner.
		<br/><br/>

		As such, we have created this application for student leaders to register their activities free of charge. After registration, we will collaborate with foreign universities and other experts in education to evaluate and select the best activities and their leaders from our applicant pool to further present to universities aboard. We will also host additional conferences (Youth Leadership Discovery Week) for interested student leaders to attend and further horn their leadership skills.
		<br/><br/>

		Once you register your activity, your activity will be automatically entering our competition pool for best activities contest in your region/sector. Some of the selection criteria we will adopt are:<br/><br/><br/>

		<div class="res_header">
			1) Originality: how innovative is the activity in its process of achieving its goal
		</div>
		<div class="res_header">
			2) Impact: the level of contribution the activity has made to its community
		</div>
		<div class="res_header">
			3) Sustainability: how well the activity can achieve lasting effect on its community/goal
		</div>
		<div class="res_header">
			4) Engagement: how engaged are the members in the activity as measured by how many members in the activitity will also register the same activity and contribute content on the application here with us.
